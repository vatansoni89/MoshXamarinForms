    (obj\Debug\netstandard2.0\GreetPage.xaml.g.cs)
  
Binding:

  StringFormat

BindingContext:
  We use it in case multiple attributes of a control being binded to single prop change(of another control).

Device.RuntimePlatform: Its used for detecting device os at run time.
  Device.Android
  Device.iOS

Property Element Syntax:
  Setting c# prop using xml element (not attribute)
    exa:
	  C# code:
	    var x = new OnPlatform<Thickness>
            {
                Android = new Thickness(0),
                iOS = new Thickness(0, 20, 0, 0)
            };
            Padding = x;

	  XAML code To set Padding prop of page:
	    <ContentPage.Padding>
			<OnPlatform x:TypeArguments="Thickness" iOS="0,20,0,0" Android="0,40,0,0">
			</OnPlatform>
		</ContentPage.Padding>

XamlCompilationOptions:
  Compile: Include xaml file as part of compilation to catch error at compile time.
  Skip this process for particular xaml file: XamlCompilation(XamlCompilationOptions.Skip)

Common Copy-Paste:
  Padding="0,20,0,0"
  
  

Layout:
  StackLayout:
    - To position element in single line, vertically or horizontally.
    - By default it fills its parent container (full yellow page.).
	- default spacing between controls is 6 px
	- default orientaion is Vertical
	- nested stacklayout allowed.
	- we set horizontalOptions or VerticalOptions as if we don't then Stacklasyout 
	  background color will spill in that direction.
  GridLayout:
    - Calculator
	- Photo Album
	- Positioning the elements: Grid.Column, Grid.Row
	- If column or Row span collides than whoever comes later wins.
	- RowSpacing: Space b/w rows.
	- ColumnSpacing: Space b/w columns.
	- View is base class for all visual elements like label, images etc.
  AbsoluteLayout:
    - Anchor elements to edge of screen
	- Overlay elements to top of each other.
	- AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds="x,y,widthPx,heightPx"
	- PositionProportional: x,y are propotional (in %)
